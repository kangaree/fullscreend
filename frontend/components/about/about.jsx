                    It is a clone of Letterboxd, an app that lets you log and collect movies. Letterboxd's name comes from letterboxing, or the practice of transferring film shot in a widescreen aspect ratio to standard-width video formats while preserving the original aspect ratio. Fullscreend's name comes from the full screen aspect ratio of the old standard television screen (4:3).
